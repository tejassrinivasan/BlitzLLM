- **Team names**: "Lakers" ‚Üí NBA, "Yankees" ‚Üí MLB
- **Player names**: "LeBron James" ‚Üí NBA, "Mike Trout" ‚Üí MLB  
- **Sport-specific terms**: "three-pointer" ‚Üí NBA, "ERA" ‚Üí MLB
- **Context clues**: Season timing, terminology, etc.

<Note>
  If the league cannot be automatically detected, Blitz will analyze the context and make the best determination, or ask for clarification in the response.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="target" title="Crafting Effective Queries">
    - **Be specific**: Instead of "How is LeBron?", ask "How has LeBron James performed this season?"
    - **Include timeframes**: "this season", "last 10 games", "playoff career"
    - **Specify metrics**: "shooting percentage", "defensive rating", "clutch performance"
    - **Add context**: Use the `extra_context` field for focused analysis
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="context" title="Using Extra Context">
    - **Focus areas**: "Focus on three-point shooting", "Emphasize defensive impact"
    - **Comparisons**: "Compare to last season", "Benchmark against league average"
    - **Situational**: "Include only playoff games", "Home vs away splits"
    - **Advanced**: "Include statistical correlations", "Show outlier games"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Response Times">
    - **Simple queries**: 2-5 seconds
    - **Complex analysis**: 10-15 seconds
    - **Multi-dimensional analysis**: 15-30 seconds
    - Use `/analyze/stream` for real-time progress on longer queries
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
