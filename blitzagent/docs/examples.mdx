## Best Practices for Queries

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="target" title="Query Specificity">
    **Good**: "Stephen Curry's three-point shooting percentage this season compared to his career average"
    
    **Better**: "Stephen Curry's three-point shooting percentage this season compared to his career average, including breakdown by game situation (catch-and-shoot vs off-dribble)"
    
    **Best**: "Stephen Curry's three-point shooting percentage this season compared to his career average, including breakdown by game situation (catch-and-shoot vs off-dribble) and distance (corner vs above-the-break), with focus on clutch time performance"
