# Predictive Analytics Workflows

Combine Blitz's sports intelligence with your proprietary data to build powerful predictive models. Use our analysis as features in machine learning pipelines for forecasting game outcomes, player performance, and market movements.

## Implementation Pattern

<CodeGroup>
```python ML Pipeline
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import asyncio

class SportsPredictor:
    def __init__(self, blitz_api_key):
        self.blitz_client = BlitzClient(blitz_api_key)
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()
        
    async def generate_features(self, team_a, team_b, date):
        """Generate features using Blitz analysis"""
        
        # Get team analysis from Blitz
        team_a_analysis = await self.blitz_client.analyze(
            f"Analyze {team_a}'s recent performance and key statistics",
            "Focus on offensive/defensive efficiency, injury status, recent form"
        )
        
        team_b_analysis = await self.blitz_client.analyze(
            f"Analyze {team_b}'s recent performance and key statistics", 
            "Focus on offensive/defensive efficiency, injury status, recent form"
        )
        
        # Get head-to-head analysis
        matchup_analysis = await self.blitz_client.analyze(
            f"{team_a} vs {team_b} matchup analysis",
            "Include historical results, key player matchups, tactical considerations"
        )
        
        # Extract numerical features from text analysis
        features = {
            'team_a_strength': self.extract_strength_score(team_a_analysis.response),
            'team_b_strength': self.extract_strength_score(team_b_analysis.response),
            'matchup_favorability': self.extract_matchup_score(matchup_analysis.response),
            'home_advantage': 1 if 'home' in team_a_analysis.response.lower() else 0
        }
        
        return features
    
    def extract_strength_score(self, analysis_text):
        """Extract a numerical strength score from text analysis"""
        # Implementation would use NLP to extract sentiment/strength indicators
        # This is a simplified example
        positive_words = ['strong', 'excellent', 'dominant', 'efficient']
        negative_words = ['struggling', 'weak', 'poor', 'inconsistent']
        
        score = 0
        for word in positive_words:
            score += analysis_text.lower().count(word)
        for word in negative_words:
            score -= analysis_text.lower().count(word)
            
        return max(0, min(10, score + 5))  # Normalize to 0-10 scale
    
    async def predict_game_outcome(self, team_a, team_b, date):
        """Predict game outcome using Blitz features + historical data"""
        
        # Generate Blitz-powered features
        blitz_features = await self.generate_features(team_a, team_b, date)
        
        # Combine with your historical/statistical features
        historical_features = self.get_historical_features(team_a, team_b)
        
        # Create feature vector
        feature_vector = {**blitz_features, **historical_features}
        
        # Make prediction
        prediction = self.model.predict([list(feature_vector.values())])
        confidence = self.model.predict_proba([list(feature_vector.values())])
        
        return {
            'predicted_winner': team_a if prediction[0] > 0.5 else team_b,
            'confidence': float(max(confidence[0])),
            'features_used': feature_vector
        }

# Usage example
predictor = SportsPredictor("your_blitz_api_key")
result = await predictor.predict_game_outcome("Lakers", "Warriors", "2024-01-15")
