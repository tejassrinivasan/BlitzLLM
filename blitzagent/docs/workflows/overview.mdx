## Integration Patterns

### 1. **API-First Integration**
Use our REST API endpoints directly in your existing systems.

```python
# Simple integration example
async def daily_content_workflow():
    # Get trending topics
    trending = await blitz_client.analyze(
        "What are the biggest NBA storylines today?",
        "Focus on recent games and breaking news"
    )
    
    # Generate social content
    content = await generate_social_post(trending.response)
    
    # Publish to platforms
    await publish_to_social_media(content)
```

### 2. **Event-Driven Workflows**
Trigger workflows based on real-time events (games, trades, injuries).

### 3. **Scheduled Workflows** 
Run automated processes at regular intervals (daily reports, weekly analysis).

### 4. **Real-time Workflows**
Respond to user requests or live events with immediate analysis.
