# Get Started with Blitz

This guide will help you start making sports analysis API calls to Blitz in just a few minutes. No installation or setup required - just get your API key and start analyzing sports data.

## Get Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create your Blitz account to get access to the sports analysis API.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Navigate to your dashboard and copy your Blitz API key. You'll use this to authenticate all API requests.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify your API key works with a simple test call:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://blitzagent.onrender.com/health" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BLITZ_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Analysis

Now let's make your first sports analysis call:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://blitzagent.onrender.com/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BLITZ_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are Stephen Curry'\''s three-point shooting stats this season?",
    "extra_context": "Focus on recent performance trends"
  }'
```

```python Python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def test_blitz():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "https://blitzagent.onrender.com/analyze",
            headers={
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_BLITZ_API_KEY",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            json={
                "query": "What are Stephen Curry's three-point shooting stats this season?",
                "extra_context": "Focus on recent performance trends"
            }
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            print("✅ Analysis successful!")
            print(f"Response: {result['response'][:200]}...")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Error: {response.status_code}")
            print(response.text)

asyncio.run(test_blitz())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const analyzeWithBlitz = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://blitzagent.onrender.com/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_BLITZ_API_KEY'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: "What are Stephen Curry's three-point shooting stats this season?",
      extra_context: "Focus on recent performance trends"
    })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    const result = await response.json();
    console.log('✅ Analysis:', result.response);
  } else {
    console.error('❌ Error:', response.status, await response.text());
  }
};

analyzeWithBlitz();
```
</CodeGroup>

class SportsAnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self, blitz_api_key):
        self.blitz = BlitzClient(blitz_api_key)
    
    async def analyze_player_performance(self, player_name, context=""):
        query = f"Analyze {player_name}'s performance this season"
        result = await self.blitz.analyze(query, context)

analysis = await agent.analyze_player_performance("LeBron James", "Focus on clutch performance")
```

```javascript Workflow Automation

  constructor(blitzApiKey) {
    this.blitzApiKey = blitzApiKey;
    this.baseUrl = 'https://blitzagent.onrender.com';
